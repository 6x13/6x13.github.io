* Description
6x13 Games  is an independent game  studio currently formed of  Kenan Bölükbaşı
and Tuğhan Yalgın,  located in Istanbul, Turkey. We  realize fresh, challenging
and  entertaining ideas  through  established design  principles and  authentic
art-styles for mobile and PC platforms. 

We are  gamer-centric, we aim to  deliver refined products and  offer smoothest
gaming experiences possible.   We support and actively use  Free/Libre and Open
Source technologies.

* History
6x13 Games began as a solo project of Kenan Bölükbaşı by the beginning of 2015.
The  non-stop  work on  a  -  yet to  be  announced  - title  was  occasionally
accompanied  by long  game design  theory  and ethics  discussions with  Tuğhan
Yalgın.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The  studio gets  its  name from  Kenan's favourite  font.   6x13 (also  called
"misc-fixed   6x13",    or   simply   "fixed")   is    the   legendary   bitmap
[[wikipedia:Fixed_(typeface)][font]]  -distributed  with  X  server-  that  has
helped developers  write code  with low-res displays,  for decades.   Even with
display technologies of  today, people still love it.  We embraced the
name as a symbol of doing so much with so little, for so long.
#+END_QUOTE

Tuğhan and Zeynep Özkan joined full-time in April.  They collaborated  on Ludum Dare
Game  Jam  with  the  jam  entry  named  Warigami  -  later  renamed  to  1FPS:
Invaders. It was intended as a warm-up  exercise for the newly formed team. The
concept was  inspired by  the unique  gameplay mechanics  of the  80s' handheld
consoles.

After about a year of game  development, careful curation of the software stack
and  development of  open source  tools to  aid game  making process,  the team
released their debut titles, 1FPS series, in November 2016.

6x13's  happy collaboration  with Zeynep  was limited  to the  first four  1FPS
titles. As  of early 2016,  6x13 Games consists  of Kenan Bölükbaşı  and Tuğhan
Yalgın.
