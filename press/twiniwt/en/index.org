* Description
Twiniwt is an elegant,  genre-defining symmetrical movement puzzle. As
you solve the hundreds of puzzles,  you also make and change the music
of the levels.

Symmetry is  going to be  both your friend  and your enemy  within the
game's more  than 250  levels. If you  move a block,  its twin  on the
other region also moves symmetrically; but  if you push the block with
another one,  its twin  won't move.  It is easier  when the  twins and
their targets  are positioned symmetrically  the same. But  when their
positions are different,  things get tricky. That is when  you need to
push the blocks  with the other ones in order  to fix target alignment
among twins.

Additionally, the regions  of the game board are circular.  If a block
is  moved or  pushed further  the  borders, it  ends up  at the  other
side. This  adds even more  depth to the  puzzle; you should  see each
region as an infinite grid, and evaluate accordingly.

Throughout  the  hundreds  of  levels, you  encounter  different  game
mechanics that add up to the variety, ie:
- Asymmetrical boards  that utilize region circularity  in a different
  way.
- Levels  with up  to  4 regions,  and 5  different  blocks that  will
  challenge your perception.
- Restricted blocks that can only move to certain directions.
- Inactive blocks that can only be pushed.
- Locking targets that turns their blocks immovable.
- Timed challenges that leave little space to think.
- Collectibles that give you much needed bonus turns.

Levels  of  Twiniwt  are   designed  with  non-linear  progression  in
mind.  Altough it  is  best to  follow the  order  in the  early-game,
solving 7 out of  10 levels is enough to unlock  the next chapter. You
can always  go back and face  those more challenging levels  later, if
you wish to do so.

Artwork is influenced  by 80's retro game-art  for parallax background
as well as early 20th century De Stijl movement for color palette.

* History
In spring  of 2015,  6x13 was  working on 1FPS:  Retro Game  Series, a
modest  (yet fun)  testbed  for  the framework  to  be  used in  their
following titles.

In a meeting during development,  Tuğhan Yalgın suggested working on a
casual puzzle in  order to reach a broader audiance  first, instead of
working  on the  initially planned  niche title.   In response,  Kenan
Bölükbaşı  came up  with the  idea  of Twiniwt,  describing the  board
structure and core mechanics of interaction.

Quick  prototyping sessions  have  shown much  potential  for fun  and
addictive gameplay, as  well as large space for  puzzle variations and
addition of complementary mechanics.

Nearly two months passed discussing  the play value and implementation
costs of potential complementary mechanics,  as well as ensuring their
interaction  with core  mechanics. It  took  tons of  test levels  and
brainstorms on edge cases to make the game rock solid, on paper.

After  that,  the team  shifted  their  focus  back on  finishing  the
framework  and  1FPS  titles.   After  completing  the  framework  and
releasing 1FPS in November 2016, development of Twiniwt continued with
full pace.

Finally,  two years  and  thousands of  daily  indie struggles  later,
Twiniwt was done.
