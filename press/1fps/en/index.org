* Description
1FPS is a  series of retro handheld  console / watch inspired  games. It brings
back  the fun  oriented mentality  of  80s with  very easy  to grasp  controls,
endless  addictive gameplay,  and complements  those with  pleasing to  look at
visuals which stay loyal to its conceptual roots.

- Dodge the enemy spaceship attacks and make them shoot each other in the fully
  customizable world of 1FPS: Invaders.
- Feed  the hungry  alien on  time  with burgers,  drinks, and  chips in  1FPS:
  Fastfood.
- Challenge your  perception and  be the first  one to make  the right  move in
  1FPS: Vacuum.
- Spray paint on  the walls and refill  your spray without getting  caught as a
  space artist in 1FPS: Graffiti.

All of those  you can do with only  two buttons.  But can you  beat the highest
score, or improve  your previous one? 1FPS takes everything  that is right with
the  80s’ retro  consoles,  combines that  with fresh  ideas  and the  untapped
potential of today’s mobile platforms.

* History
1FPS series originally  started in Ludum Dare  Game Jam in April  2015 with the
jam entry named Warigami - later renamed  to 1FPS: Invaders. It was intended as
a warm-up exercise for  the newly formed team. The concept  was inspired by the
unique gameplay mechanics of the 80s' handheld consoles. The core gameplay idea
came  from  [[twitter:engingunesoglu][Engin  Güneşoğlu]].  Upon  realizing  the
fresh  and mobile  friendly gameplay  of  the jam  entry, the  team decided  to
concentrate on the style for a while and turn it into a series.  Thus, 1FPS was
born.  The name is a humorous reference to its nostalgic LCD screen animations.

1FPS also means the debut for 6x13 Games as a truly independent game studio.

* Features
- 4 different retro watch inspired games from slow to high-paced action.
  - Endless possibilities;  customize your  gameplay in any  way you  want with
    1FPS: Invaders, or let the game pick up a random setting for you.
  - Educational gameplay that improves your intuition with 1FPS: Vacuum.
  - Pacey decision making fun with 1FPS: Fastfood.
- All _completely free_ to download and play.
- Lightweight and highly optimized for mobile devices.
- Beautiful colors, pleasing to look at visuals.
- Nostalgic visual and sound effects.
- Simple and mobile friendly controls; just two buttons.
- Learn how to play in seconds; no overwhelming tutorials.
- Endless gameplay; go as far as you can and beat the highest scores.

** 1FPS: Fastfood
You are a service robot who works in an intergalactic fast food store. There is
a very hungry  alien who keeps ordering  3 different kinds of  fast food: Soda,
fries, burgers. You should watch the alien's  hand, and try not to drop what it
orders.

You should deliver (bounce) the order not to lose hit points, and deliver extra
food to earn  points. It is a  simple quick desicion making game  which may get
complicated as it gets faster.

** 1FPS: Invaders
An action arcade  game in space with  one big difference: You  can't shoot! But
you can make the  enemy ships shoot each other as they try  to hit you instead,
and that's how you earn points. Game has two phases: Blue Phase where you dodge
the attacks,  and survive. And short  Green Phase where you  can replenish your
health with the enemy missiles.

1FPS:  Invaders comes  with 3  different  game modes.  It also  gives you  many
customization options in  which you can set  up your own levels,  play with the
game mechanics as you like.

** 1FPS: Vacuum
An educational, intergalactic  mathematics contest. You play as one  of the two
contestants. The aim is to solve  basic math quizzes before your opponent does,
compare whose result is bigger, and  then take action accordingly. Every action
you take in Vacuum  has a consequence. Mistakes will cost  you points, and even
hit points.

The main rule is: bigger result wins. But that doesn't mean all is lost if your
result is lower, you can "dodge" your opponent's move if you're fast. Likewise,
having the bigger result means nothing,  if your opponent dodges you before you
discard first. As you keep playing, you'll  start to be amazed at yourself that
how faster you can solve than you think.
